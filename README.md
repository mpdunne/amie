# Amie: French learning assistant

Amie is a GPT-based assistant for learning French! Run `python amie.py` to run!

Dump your vocab in .csv, .txt, or .md files in `raw/`. Then run `process_notes.py` to load them into Amie's memory. Then from within `amie` you can type `/vocab` to switch to vocab mode and practice your words until you've mastered them!
